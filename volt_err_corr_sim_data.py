This script aims to reproduce the results shown in Fig.2 (open symbols)
from Ref. Specifically, currents generated from PKA-treated GluR6 receptors.
Simulated data are generated importing "exponential.py" and are corrected
following the paper guidelines.

# Data structure is as follow:
# <raw/new>_data variables are two-dimentional arrays:
#   1. time datapoints are on the first dimension (<raw/new>_data[0])
#   2. current datapoints are on the second dimension (<raw/new>_data[1])
# <new>_currents variable is a one-dimensional array:
#   1. current datapoints

######## SAMPLE DATA GENERATION ########

# Simulated unfiltered data from Fig.2 open symbols.
# Time in ms and currents in pA.

# Print the values of time and current every 5 (total 11)
#print(raw_data[0][1::5])
#print(raw_data[1][1::5])
# Print the shape of the array
#print(np.shape(raw_data))

# Transform the time values from ms to seconds
raw_data[0] /= 1000 # from ms to seconds
#print(raw_data[0][1::5])

# Transform the current values from pA to Amperes
raw_data[1] /= 1000000000000 # from pA to Amperes
# Print the transformed values of current every 5 (total 11)
#print(raw_data[1][1::5])

# What is the time interval between datapoints?
#for i in range(1, np.shape(raw_data)[1]):
